# Sketch Resources
I always use these components so I might as well put these here. I'll be putting more of my work here. Just a heads up, these components are highly opinionated.

## Plugins
- [Sketch for Designers](http://sketch.fordesignrs.com/)

## Workflow
- Set colors. I usually layout all of my colors on a grid of 100px by 100px squares.
- My basic colors are Black, White, Primary Brand Color, Secondary Brand Color, Error, Warning, Success and 4-5 shades of gray. The grays could have hints of the Primary or Secondary Brand Colors.
- Save each color as a Symbol. Name them with the prefix "Background / color-name". These will now be used as backgrounds for all of your components (e.g. buttons, panels, footer, etc.)
- Set typography (Normal, Secondary, Disabled, Accent).
- The Normal type is usually Black. The Secondary and Disabled types are usually transparent versions of the Normal type's color (e.g. 75% and 50%).
- The Accent color is usually the Primary or Secondary Brand Color.
- I also have White type and transparent versions sometimes. I name them with the prefix "White / " or "White40 / " for those with transparency where 40 is the opacity of the style. 
- Arrange type according to weight (light to heavy). This makes it easier to select their respective styles later on.
- Use "Normal / ", "Accent / ", Disabled / ", and "Secondary / " for the layer names.
- Sync styles using Craft. Only the Normal and Accent Styles will be synced because Craft ignores opacity in styles.
- Go back to Typography Page or Artboard and assign each Normal and Accent type it's respective style. They are already using the styles you saved but for some weird reason, it doesn't show up on Sketch's inspector.
- In the Typography page, save each Disabled and Secondary Style as a Shared Style. This process is going to be tedious but trust me, it's really worth it when you start building bigger components.
